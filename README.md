# BitOrderConverter
Convert the bit order of hex values in c (txt) file

Category: Utility
Language: C++
Input/Ouput: any text file, but the file extension cannot be .txt because the output will be the same file name with .txt extention
Example: Use input file test.c to generate output file test.txt
Use case: I use it to change the bit order for LCD fonts because different LCD manufacturers use different format.
